  s.description      = <<-DESC
This is an NSImage enhancement displaying a small progressbar.
Why NSImage? The main point was to create a progressbar usable in menu extras (menubar)
or in context menus and those items can contain only NSImages. ProgressImage is a small
configurable image displaying graphical progress so you can visualize any progress up
in the menu extras bar for example.
